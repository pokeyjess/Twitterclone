# Twitterclone -- attack of the Kenzie clones!

## Features

Here's my version of a Twitter 'clone' application, using Django and meeting all of the rubric requirements for Q-4 at Kenzie Academy.

Just like the original Twitter, this app allows you to post 140-character "Tweets" for your followers to see. Each post is marked with a time stamp.

Your homepage lists all of your “Tweets,” along with the posts of the people you are following. You can easily choose to "follow" or "unfollow" other users — a list of users who you are not following appears on the homepage, so you can browse to see if there’s anyone you might want to connect with. 

The information on your "profile page" is visible to those who are not logged into the system, provided they know your “display name” and how to use it to access the URL of your page.

Users who are not logged in can also view a detailed page showing your individual posts. This way, you can gain new followers by attracting them to your posts!
